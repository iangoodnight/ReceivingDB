# User guide

Everything you need to know to successfully navigate ReceivingDB, from search
and browsing to auditing and administrating user accounts, users can find the
answer here.

## Browsing and searching

ReceivingDB offers several ways to browse and search receiving log entries.  No
user account is required to search or browse ReceivingDB, though the web portal
itself may be restricted to an IP address or set of IP addresses.  Opening
access to the search and browse function cuts down on user account management,
as being on the same domain is enough to allow casual users to find the
information they need.

### Browsing

To browse the receiving log from ReceivingDB, select "Browse" from the
navigation menu.

The resulting page will load the last seven days of receiving log entries, from
newest to oldest, for you to browse through.  Click on any row, and use the
arrow keys or the tab key to navigate.  Selecting "Next" will take you back a
week, continuously until you run out of entries

Double-clicking on any row or pressing the enter key with a row selected will
take you to the entry details page.  From here, you can see items that were
shipped together as part of the same purchase order.
