# ReceivingDB

![ReceivingDB Banner](/assets/banner.png)

Keeping a detailed, accurate receiving log is essential to reliable inventory
management and effective resource planning.  It is vital that receiving log
entries be detailed, searchable, and protected from changes.  Utilizing MongoDB
on the back-end provides a scalable extensible database platform that can grow
as business needs change.  Completely server-side rendered, mobile-friendly,
and installable as a Progressive Web Application, pages load fast, getting the
data needed for day-to-day operations closest to the people who own those
processes.  ReceivingDB separates the ability to write (create new) entries
from the ability to audit (makes changes to) entries with no user account
required to search and browse the receiving log (though the entire web
interface can still be restricted by IP address).  Defining role-based access
in this manner saves on the overhead of creating and maintaining user accounts
for casual users, treats the log itself as a write-only interface, and still
allows for versioned changes if required.  These controls allow for ReceivingDB
to be a reliable, auditable, searchable cornerstone to a more comprehensive
open-source inventory management and resource planning implementation.

## Installation and getting started

To get ReceivingDB up and running, you will need:

1.) A MongoDB instance
2.) A locally or cloud-hosted installation of ReceivingDB

### Setting up MongoDB

ReceivingDB requires a MongoDB connection string as an environment variable to
set up database services.  A self-hosted MongoDB instance is an option, but for
the quickest, most straightforward setup, create a [MongoDB Atlas account] and
set up a cluster there.
